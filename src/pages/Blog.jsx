          <p className="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
            The hoodie has evolved beyond sportswear. In Lagos, it’s become a symbol of urban culture, worn by creatives, entrepreneurs, and streetwear lovers.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
            At NZURI, we craft hoodies that aren’t just comfortable — they’re statements. Here’s how to style your NZURI hoodie across different Lagos settings:
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mt-6 mb-2 text-yellow-400">1. Victoria Island: Streetwear Meets Sophistication</h3>
          <p className="mb-4 text-base">
            Pair your Core Black hoodie with tailored joggers and white Air Force 1s. Add minimal accessories like chain necklaces and aviator sunglasses for a look that balances luxury and loungewear.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mt-6 mb-2 text-yellow-400">2. Lekki: Casual Cool</h3>
          <p className="mb-4 text-base">
            Keep it relaxed with a layered look — hoodie over a plain tee, neutral shorts, and a crossbody bag. Perfect for a weekend hangout at Terra Kulture or Freedom Park.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mt-6 mb-2 text-yellow-400">3. Surulere: Local Vibes</h3>
          <p className="mb-6 text-base">
            Go bold with color blocking — wear your Oatmeal Cream hoodie with indigo jeans or cargo pants. Accessorize with a cap and local beadwork for a unique twist.
          </p>

          <p className="italic text-gray-500">
            The key to styling a hoodie is balance. At NZURI, we believe in making fashion functional — so wherever you are in Nigeria, make it yours.

          <p className="text-gray-400 mb-4">Published: June 15, 2025</p>

          <p className="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
            Fashion today is flooded with fast production cycles and mass manufacturing. At NZURI, we do the opposite — create intentionally, produce minimally, and release with purpose.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mt-6 mb-2 text-yellow-400">The Value of Exclusivity</h3>
          <p className="mb-4 text-base">
            When something is limited, its value increases — not just financially, but emotionally. Owning a piece from a small run means owning a story, a moment, and a movement.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mt-6 mb-2 text-yellow-400">Quality Over Quantity</h3>
          <p className="mb-4 text-base">
            Each NZURI hoodie is crafted in batches of no more than 400 units. This ensures attention to detail, consistent quality, and intentional design.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mt-6 mb-2 text-yellow-400">For the Nigerian Creative</h3>
          <p className="mb-6 text-base">
            Whether you're an artist, designer, or entrepreneur — wearing a limited edition hoodie says something about who you are and what you stand for.
          </p>

          <p className="italic text-gray-500">
            We don't chase trends. We invest in timelessness — one batch at a time.

          <p className="text-gray-400 mb-4">Published: June 10, 2025</p>

          <p className="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
            Monochrome doesn't mean boring. It means intentional. It means clean lines, strong silhouettes, and a focus on texture over pattern.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mt-6 mb-2 text-yellow-400">The Power of One Color</h3>
          <p className="mb-4 text-base">
            Our oatmeal cream and core black collections are designed to be versatile. These pieces can be layered, mixed, and matched without ever clashing.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mt-6 mb-2 text-yellow-400">Clean Design, Bold Impact</h3>
          <p className="mb-4 text-base">
            With structured shoulders, double-stitched seams, and inner waistband tags, every detail tells a story — even if only you know it.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mt-6 mb-2 text-yellow-400">Minimalism That Speaks Volumes</h3>
          <p className="mb-6 text-base">
            Monochrome dressing lets you focus on cut, fabric, and fit — the real markers of style. It’s less about the logo, more about the lifestyle.
          </p>

          <p className="italic text-gray-500">
            Less noise. More meaning. That’s the NZURI way.
